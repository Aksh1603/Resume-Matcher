# Akshaya's Applicant Tracking System 

========================================

An NLP project built using python 

========================================

My project leverages Python's NLP capabilities to create a robust job description and resume matcher. It efficiently processes multiple resumes, extracts key information, and compares them against a given job description. By employing advanced NLP techniques, the system accurately calculates similarity scores, ranking resumes based on their relevance to the job requirements. This intelligent tool significantly streamlines the recruitment process by providing recruiters with a prioritized list of highly qualified candidates.
